# FMT Workday App

## Basic Usage

The app is written to function on mobile browsers.  It should work on iPhones, iPads, Android phones and tablets.  It will also work on a desktop browser, provided you are able to provide a GPS location.

## Signing In

The home screen is set to show a sign in button.  You can also use the navigation button at the top.  When you sign in, you will be asked to provide your name.  If you are a cast member working for yourself, this would be your name.  If you are working on behalf of someone else, you will put your name.  Multiple people can work for a single cast member at the same time.

There are a few checks put in place.  First, you must be on location at Cedar Valley to be able to sign in with the app, since it checks geolocation.  *Please allow geolocation when prompted!* Also, you must fill and submit the form fairly quickly, since the geolocation token will expire if you wait too long to submit.  If this happens, you can simply refresh the page to get a new token.

All fields must be filled to submit the form, and upon submission, you should get a success message.

## Signing Out

Signing out is a little simpler.  Select your name from the dropdown list.  Verify you have selected the correct entry before you submit.  Upon successful submission, you should get a success message.

## Lookup Hours

One of the helpful functions of the app is the ability to see history and number of hours logged.  You can access this functionality from the button at the top or at the bottom.  Pick your name from the dropdown and submit.
